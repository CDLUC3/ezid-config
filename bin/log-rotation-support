#! /bin/bash

# Support for rotation and culling of access log files.  This script
# runs in conjunction with an Apache rotatelogs configuration, and
# should be run via cron shortly after rotatelogs ever rotates a log
# file (typically at midnight).  Does two things: 1) keeps only the
# most recent 6 files; and 2) creates a symlink from "access_log" to
# the most recent log file.  The latter is needed because our older
# version of rotatelogs doesn't support creating links or much of
# anything else.
