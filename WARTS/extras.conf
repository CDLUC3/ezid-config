# Until rewriting works on N2T, redirect everything to noid service resolver
# Note:  would have done IncludeOptional WARTS/extras.conf but that doesn't
#        work before Apache 2.3.6.  Could use the %{ENV:noid-wf-cdlib.org}
#        trick because %{ENV:...} doesn't work except on lhs of RewriteCond.
